# 1. Purpose of Project

When selecting modeling in machine learning, the most important thing is performance. Comparing the performance of each model only through numbers is not intuitively recognizable. The main purpose of the MIA-Visual is to visually represent the performance of the models so that users can easily select models. For this purpose, three functions will be provided.

  1. Visualize the learning curve to validate model complexity

  - It is not easy to compare the complexity of each model in numbers. It makes it possible to intuitively check this through visualization of the learning curve.

  2. Visualize the machine learning step-by-step weight update process

  - Machine learning can only check the final weight. How weights are optimized is also shown through visualization to help important people.
  
  3. Visualize classification model performance evaluation metrics and feature importance indicators

  - It visually represents the model's indicators, making it easier to compare them with other models

The difference from the existing model performance visualization is automation. In the past, it was necessary to set the x-axis and y-axis for the graph, select what kind of graph to draw, and write a code and check it. Our purpose is to draw a graph automatically through one method.

# 2. How to start a project

It will be written in addition to Matplob OpenSource, so installing the Matplob library is essential to use this project.
