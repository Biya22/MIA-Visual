The three problems raised above can be solved using the following visualization tools: MIA_Visual (Model Intuitive Assessment_Visualization) is an open source project. ‘Learning curve analysis visualization’ helps determine if this model is reliable. ‘The visualization of the weightupdate process’ helps to intuitively determine how the weights are being updated gradually. Through the ‘visualization of classification model performance evaluation indicators’, it is possible to help intuitively understand each evaluation indicator and to help select the appropriate model.
